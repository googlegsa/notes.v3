Release 3.2.0, October 2013
===========================

This is an upgrade release with performance enhancements and bug fixes.
Users of version 2.8.4 through 3.0.8 are encouraged to upgrade.

Summary of Changes:
------------------
  * Fix issue 7541432: Remove document attachments from the GSA when
    its parent document is deleted in Notes database.
  * Fix issue 7734727: When ACLs are sent to the GSA, they are dependent on
    the user and group cache being built, so incorrect ACLs are sent.
  * Fix out of memory issue: Invoke Garbage Collector on the maintenance
    thread in every 1000 documents when it traverses a large directory.
  * Fix issue 10101254: Fix NullPointerException thrown by missing attachment.

    name when group name is in canonical format.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
Connector instances created using versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.8 may be used with
this version.  For earlier versions, see upgrade instructions in version 3.0.8
below.  This version works with Connector Manager version 3.0.0 or later.



Release 3.0.8, May 2013
=======================

This is an upgrade release with performance enhancements and bug fixes.
Users of version 2.8.4 through 3.0.4 are encouraged to upgrade.

Summary of Changes:
-------------------
  * Fix issue 7623238: Support different authentication and authorization
    mechanisms by providing a configuration for three username types such as
    UserName (default), Domain\UserName and UserName@internet.com.  Customers
    need to refresh the design of the GSA Configuration database using the
    gsa-connector.ntf template in order to have the configuration for username
    types.
  * Fix issue 7635407: Add "-default-" group to user's groups once the user is
    authenticated during serve time.

    and DEPOSITOR users as denied groups and users to the GSA respectively.
  * Fix issue 8319071: Create indexes automatically for all lookups and joins
    in H2 database.
  * Fix issue 8333989: Fix the query to lookup roles which users inherit from
    direct group membership, parent groups and wildcard members.
  * Fix issue 8761274: Fix an exception encountered when the connector
    traverses a large Names and Address Book to update directory cache.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
Connector instances created using versions 2.8.6 or older will need to migrate
the Lotus Notes GSA Configuration database to a new database instance using the
GSA Configuration template version 3.0.0 or later.  Please refer to the "Guide
to the Google Search Appliance Connector for Lotus Notes 3.0" document for more
details.  Customers need to refresh the design of the GSA Configuration
database using the gsa-connector.ntf template in order to have the configuration
for username types.  This version works with Connector Manager version 3.0.0
or later.



Release 3.0.4, December 2012
============================

This is an upgrade release with performance enhancements.  Users of version
2.8.4 through 3.0.0 are encouraged to upgrade.


Summary of Changes
------------------
  * Fix issue 7431512: Notes tables are missing indexes.  This fix is to
    initialize table indexes automatically when they are missing.
  * Suppress Java 7 compilation warnings during the build unification.



Release 3.0.0, October 2012
===========================
 
This is an upgrade release with performance enhancements and bug fixes.
Users of versions 2.8.4 and 2.8.6 are encouraged to upgrade.
 
 
Summary of Changes
------------------
  * People, groups and indexed documents are cached in a local H2 database 
    instead of the Lotus Notes GSA Configuration database.  This enhancement
    improves performances significantly during crawling and serving times.
  * With GSA 7.0, document security with reader fields is supported along
    with database ACLs using per-URL ACLs.  Document ACLs include the
    readers and inherit from a separately indexed database ACL.  With GSA
    6.14 or earlier, the ACL feature is unchanged and only supports 
    database ACLs using policy ACLs.  
  * Fix Issue 7033516: Support wildcard configuration in Lotus Notes
    database ACLs and in group members.  This fix was reimplemented in
    version 3.0.0 due to changes to internal local H2 database cache.
  * Fix Issue 7045713: Circularly linked groups cause connector to abort
    users and groups cache population.
  * Fix Issues 7296180: Deletion checking does not resume after an
    exception.
 
 
Version Compatibility
---------------------
For existing customers, a migration of the existing Lotus Notes GSA
Configuration database to a new database instance using the GSA
Configuration template version 3.0.0 is required.  Please refer to the
"Guide to the Google Search Appliance Connector for Lotus Notes 3.0"
document for more details.
 
 
 
Release 2.8.6, August 2012
==========================

This is an upgrade release with some enhancements.  Users of version 
2.8.4 are encouraged to upgrade.


Summary of Changes
------------------
  * Fix Issue 6410562: The connector skips bad or corrupted person
    documents in Lotus Notes directory which are created without user's
    full names.
  * Fixed Issue 6622121: The connector is not removing indexed documents
    cached in the GSA Configuration database.
  * Fixed Issue 6922704: The connector is not removing users from the GSA
    Configuration database when users are removed from the Lotus Notes
    directory.
  * Fix Issue 7033516: The connector supports wildcard configuration in
    database ACL for secured content authorized via connector mechanism.



Release 2.8.4, March 2012
=========================

This version of the connector is a major update to the Google
Search Appliance Connector for Lotus Notes.

There is no migration from previous versions of the connector to
version 2.8 since the connectors have completely different
architectures.

The following are new or changed features of the connector:

* The connector is now implemented using the Connector Manager
  and runs on Apache Tomcat using the Lotus Notes client to access
  applications on the Domino server.
* The Agent Manager and HTTP Server task are no longer used to
  run agents and are no longer required.
* Connector authentication and authorization replace SAML
  authentication and authorization.
* Connector code run entirely in Tomcat however the configuration
  database remains in Domino.
* Significant improvements in reliability, scalability for
  traversal.
* The Domino XML export and transformation is no longer used.
* Formulas replace field lists for generating default document
  titles and descriptions.
* Custom meta data fields can be configured in the application
  template.
* Domino application ACLs can be sent to the GSA as Policy ACLs
  improving authorization performance and eliminating the need to
  re-index documents when application ACLs change.
* Connector Authorization enforces "No Access" for users in an
  application ACL.
* Mapping of file extensions to MIME types is exposed.
* Default Meta data names have been changed.
* Attachments are extracted to a directory on the local Notes
  client greatly reducing the size of the GSA connector database.
* Up to 2MB of text in richtext fields are sent to the GSA for
  indexing.
* The directory monitor now does a progressive update so
  authentication and authorization can continue uninterrrupted.

Version Compatibility
---------------------


Lotus Connector Features
------------------------
  * Native Lotus Notes Application

    The Connector is a native Notes application and can be installed
    on any Notes server platform R6 or later. The Connector supports
    any Notes database regardless of its design and search results at
    the GSA can be opened in the browser or using the Notes client.

  * Full and Incremental Crawling

    For each database, you can choose which documents and fields you
    wish to index using the template configurations The Connector will
    crawl the registered databases in "Full" mode the first time and
    the subsequent crawls will be incremental with only the
    added/modified/deleted documents getting crawled and submitted to
    the GSA.

  * Honors Document Level Security

    The system integrates with GSA security to ensure that only
    documents that a user has at least Reader access to in the source
    databases are displayed in the search results. The Connector
    respects all levels of security (database ACL and document level
    items) including ACL roles present in Readers/Authors fields. The
    Connector also monitors the ACL of each database and where changes
    are made that impact the confidentiality of contained documents,
    the system will automatically recreate index entries with the
    updated security information.

  * Replica Awareness

    Built in understanding of the location of your servers. This
    ensures that duplicate content can never be submitted to the GSA
    where replicas of databases reside on multiple servers.

  * Support for Notes Field conversion to GSA Meta Field

    Any Notes field can be made available as GSA <Meta > value using
    the stylesheet.

  * Notes Document Versioning Support 

    Where a Notes application saves each update as a new Notes
    document, (such as a document management application) you can
    choose to have the Connector remove all prior versions of the
    saved document from the GSA as the new version is added to the
    index. This ensures that your users are only ever presented with
    the latest version of the document in the search results.

Known Issues
------------
  * "No Access" rules are not currently supported if using Per-URL ACLs.
  * Crawl Interval not configurable up to seconds interval.
  * Domino HTTP Port Number is not configurable.
